## Installation / Setup Guide for the Voting System:

1. Download the votesystem.rar, votesystem.sql, and bower_components.rar or download the whole repository.

2. After downloading them Unzip the files you downloaded one by one.

3. Copy the bower_components folder and Paste it inside the votesystem folder.
(The bower_components folder contains bootstraps that are needed for our voting system. As its file size is bigger than the file size limit on github, I have to seperate it on the votesystem folder.)

4. Open your PHPmyadmin page and create a database named 'votesystem'.

5. Under votesystem database, import the votesystem.sql file that you downloaded earlier.

6. Copy the votesystem folder (assuming you are done doing #3) into the htdocs folder located under the xampp files/folders.

7. After those 6 steps, you are done setting up your voting system! You can now vote and/or modify the election together with its voters and candidates!
